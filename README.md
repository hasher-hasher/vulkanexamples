# Vulkan Examples
Those are my personal experiments with Vulkan API. Maybe some specific usage I needed to figure out to my engine or anything related, you'll find it here.

### Examples at the moment:
- How to render the scene into a texture

# Disclaimer
- The code quality is really not guaranteed. I'd like all the examples to have a good code to be easy to read and understand, but I'm pretty busy with some personal projects so it's possible that you'll spend a while trying to understand what is happening. Hopefully in a near future I'll refactor some things.
